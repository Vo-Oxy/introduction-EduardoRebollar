## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?
My favorite part has to be learning how to create graphics on Java because by being able to draw or import anything you want, I have been able to create drawings,
simple animations, and a fun video game.

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?
The hardest part of CS I've learned so far that I find my head hard to wrap around is probably understanding how the call stack and the heap work with one another.
I had already learned the 'how' behind Java code, how to code what I would like to, but trying to understand 'why' it is the way it is and how the memory
stored works is challenging.

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?
I'm looking forward to seeing how fundamentally algorithms work since I always hear talk of algorithms learning from humans or humans teaching algorithms.
It sounds interesting.
